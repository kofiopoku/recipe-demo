            <h1>American Thanksgiving</h1>

            <p>In the United States, the modern Thanksgiving holiday tradition
            is commonly, but not universally, traced to a poorly documented
            1621 celebration at Plymouth in present-day Massachusetts. The 1621
            Plymouth feast and thanksgiving was prompted by a good harvest.
            Pilgrims and Puritans who began emigrating from England in the
            1620s and 1630s carried the tradition of Days of Fasting and Days
            of Thanksgiving with them to New England. Several days of
            Thanksgiving were held in early New England history that have been
            identified as the "First Thanksgiving", including Pilgrim holidays
            in Plymouth in 1621 and 1623, and a Puritan holiday in Boston in
            1631. According to historian Jeremy Bangs, director of the Leiden
            American Pilgrim Museum, the Pilgrims may have been influenced by
            watching the annual services of Thanksgiving for the relief of the
            siege of Leiden in 1574, while they were staying in Leiden. In
            later years, religious thanksgiving services were declared by civil
            leaders such as Governor Bradford, who planned a thanksgiving
            celebration and fast in 1623.The practice of holding an annual
            harvest festival did not become a regular affair in New England
            until the late 1660s.</p>

            <p>Thanksgiving proclamations were made mostly by church leaders in
            New England up until 1682, and then by both state and church
            leaders until after the American Revolution. During the
            revolutionary period, political influences affected the issuance of
            Thanksgiving proclamations. Various proclamations were made by
            royal governors, John Hancock, General George Washington, and the
            Continental Congress, each giving thanks to God for events
            favorable to their causes. As President of the United States,
            George Washington proclaimed the first nation-wide thanksgiving
            celebration in America marking November 26, 1789, "as a day of
            public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with
            grateful hearts the many and signal favours of Almighty God".</p>

            <p>In modern times the President of the United States, in addition
            to issuing a proclamation, will "pardon" a turkey, which spares the
            bird's life and ensures that it will spend the duration of its life
            roaming freely on farmland.</p>
